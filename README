zebra1
Python app to direct print product labels to a Zebra or other ZPL compatible printer
Windows and Linux printers are supported.
It is also possible to print direct to a network connected ZPL printer bypassing printer drivers (my preferred method)
Data is retrieved from Starshipit via the API. API Credentials are stored in the .ini file in clear text.

.zpl files contain the ZPL formatted label to be printed. Various merge codes can be included in the template and are substituted from the API data.
.csv files can be used to print a series of labels at one time. Normally this is used to print warehouse location labels. 
     The CSV file is free form but the headings must use valid merge codes.
